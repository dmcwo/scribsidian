> The “Spotlight” Our immediate capacities for navigating awareness and action toward tasks. Enables us to do what we want to do. The “Starlight” Our broader capacities for navigating life “by the stars” of our higher goals and values. Enables us to be who we want to be. The “Daylight” Our fundamental capacities – such as reflection, metacognition, reason, and intelligence – that enable us to define our goals and values to begin with. Enables us to “want what we want to want.” These three “lights” of attention pertain to doing, being, and knowing, respectively.
